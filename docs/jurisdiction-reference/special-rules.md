# Special Jurisdiction Rules - Deep Dive

## Introduction

While most Canadian jurisdictions follow similar patterns in labour relations law, **three jurisdictions have unique rules** that require special attention:

1. **Manitoba**: 65% super-majority strike vote requirement
2. **Saskatchewan**: 45% of all eligible members (not votes cast)
3. **Quebec**: Bilingual requirements and calendar day deadlines

This guide provides **in-depth analysis** of these special rules, including historical context, practical implications, and strategic guidance.

## 1. Manitoba Super-Majority (65%)

### Legal Foundation

**Statute**: Labour Relations Act, CCSM c L10, s.68  
**Requirement**: Strike vote must be supported by **at least 65%** of votes cast

### Historical Context

Manitoba is the **only jurisdiction in Canada** that requires a super-majority for strike votes. This requirement was introduced in **1996** under the Gary Filmon government as part of broader labour relations reforms.

**Legislative Intent:**
- Ensure strong membership support before strike action
- Reduce "narrow majority" strikes that divide the membership
- Encourage negotiated settlements by raising the strike authorization bar

**Controversy:**
The 65% requirement has been challenged multiple times as an infringement on workers' right to strike. However, courts have upheld it as a valid exercise of provincial legislative authority over labour relations.

### Practical Implications

#### For Union Organizers

**Challenge**: Achieving 65% support requires strong solidarity and effective communication.

**Best Practices:**
1. **Pre-vote education**: Ensure all members understand the issues and stakes
2. **Address concerns**: One-on-one conversations with skeptical members
3. **Timing**: Don't call a vote until you're confident of 70%+ support (safety margin)
4. **Turnout strategy**: High turnout is essential - low turnout favors "No" votes

**Example Scenario:**
```
Union has 1,000 members eligible to vote.
Scenario A: 800 members vote
- Need: 800 × 0.65 = 520 "Yes" votes
- Result: 520 "Yes" → PASSES (exactly 65%)

Scenario B: 500 members vote (low turnout)
- Need: 500 × 0.65 = 325 "Yes" votes
- Result: 350 "Yes" → PASSES (70% of votes cast)
- But: Only 35% of all members voted "Yes" (weaker mandate)

Scenario C: 900 members vote (high turnout)
- Need: 900 × 0.65 = 585 "Yes" votes
- Result: 580 "Yes" → FAILS (64.4%, just short)
```

**Key Insight**: In Manitoba, a strike vote can fail even with **64.9% support**. There is no rounding - the threshold is strict.

#### Comparison to Other Jurisdictions

| Jurisdiction | Threshold | Example: 650 Yes / 1,000 Votes Cast |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Manitoba** | 65% | ✅ PASSES (65.0%) |
| **New Brunswick** | 60% | ✅ PASSES (65.0%) |
| **All Others** | 50%+1 | ✅ PASSES (65.0%) |

| Jurisdiction | Threshold | Example: 640 Yes / 1,000 Votes Cast |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Manitoba** | 65% | ❌ FAILS (64.0%) |
| **New Brunswick** | 60% | ✅ PASSES (64.0%) |
| **All Others** | 50%+1 | ✅ PASSES (64.0%) |

**Strategy Tip**: If your union operates in multiple provinces, educate Manitoba members about the higher threshold to avoid disappointment or false expectations.

### Legal Challenges

**Key Cases:**
- **United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 832 v. Manitoba (AG)** [2003]: Challenge to 65% requirement dismissed
- **Manitoba Labour Board decisions**: Numerous cases clarifying "votes cast" vs. "eligible members"

**Court Reasoning:**
- Provincial jurisdiction over labour relations is broad
- 65% requirement is not unconstitutional interference with freedom of association
- Legislature can set reasonable procedural requirements for strike votes

## 2. Saskatchewan Special Calculation (45% of Eligible Members)

### Legal Foundation

**Statute**: Labour Relations Act, 1995, SS 1994-95, c L-0.2, s.6(2)  
**Requirement**: Strike vote must be supported by **at least 45%** of **all employees in the bargaining unit**, not just those who voted.

### Unique Calculation Method

Saskatchewan is the **only jurisdiction** where the strike vote threshold is calculated based on **all eligible members**, not votes cast.

**Why This Matters:**
In all other jurisdictions, abstentions don't affect the result. In Saskatchewan, **abstentions count as "No" votes**.

**Formula:**
```
Other Jurisdictions: (Yes Votes / Votes Cast) ≥ 50%
Saskatchewan:       (Yes Votes / Total Eligible Members) ≥ 45%
```

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: High Turnout (90%)

```
Eligible Members: 1,000
Members Who Vote: 900 (90% turnout)
Vote Yes: 500
Vote No: 400

Other Jurisdictions:
500 / 900 = 55.6% → ✅ PASSES

Saskatchewan:
500 / 1,000 = 50% → ✅ PASSES (exceeds 45% threshold)
```

**Result**: Passes in both Saskatchewan and other jurisdictions.

#### Example 2: Low Turnout (50%)

```
Eligible Members: 1,000
Members Who Vote: 500 (50% turnout)
Vote Yes: 450
Vote No: 50

Other Jurisdictions:
450 / 500 = 90% → ✅ PASSES (overwhelming support)

Saskatchewan:
450 / 1,000 = 45% → ✅ PASSES (exactly meets threshold)
```

**Result**: Passes in both jurisdictions, but in Saskatchewan it's just barely.

#### Example 3: Lower Turnout (40%)

```
Eligible Members: 1,000
Members Who Vote: 400 (40% turnout)
Vote Yes: 380 (95% of votes cast!)
Vote No: 20

Other Jurisdictions:
380 / 400 = 95% → ✅ PASSES (overwhelming support)

Saskatchewan:
380 / 1,000 = 38% → ❌ FAILS (below 45% threshold)
```

**Result**: Passes in other jurisdictions but **fails in Saskatchewan** despite 95% of voters supporting the strike.

### Implications for Union Organizers

#### Challenge: Turnout is Critical

In Saskatchewan, you cannot win a strike vote with low turnout, no matter how overwhelming the support among those who vote.

**Best Practices:**
1. **Target 50%+ turnout**: Aim for at least half of all members to vote "Yes"
2. **Member tracking**: Maintain accurate lists of all eligible members
3. **Absentee voting**: Provide multiple ways to vote (in-person, mail, online)
4. **Follow-up**: Personal outreach to members who haven't voted
5. **Extended voting periods**: Give members multiple days/times to vote

**Example Scenario:**
```
Your union has 1,000 eligible members.
You need: 1,000 × 0.45 = 450 "Yes" votes minimum

Turnout Goals:
- If 100% turnout: Need 450 Yes (45% of total)
- If 90% turnout: Need 450 Yes (50% of those who vote)
- If 80% turnout: Need 450 Yes (56% of those who vote)
- If 70% turnout: Need 450 Yes (64% of those who vote)
- If 60% turnout: Need 450 Yes (75% of those who vote)
```

**Key Insight**: As turnout drops, you need increasingly overwhelming support among voters to reach 45% of all members.

#### Comparison to Manitoba

| Scenario | Manitoba (65% of votes cast) | Saskatchewan (45% of eligible) |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 500 vote, 450 Yes | 450/500 = 90% → ✅ PASSES | 450/1,000 = 45% → ✅ PASSES |
| 500 vote, 325 Yes | 325/500 = 65% → ✅ PASSES | 325/1,000 = 32.5% → ❌ FAILS |
| 700 vote, 455 Yes | 455/700 = 65% → ✅ PASSES | 455/1,000 = 45.5% → ✅ PASSES |
| 400 vote, 380 Yes | 380/400 = 95% → ✅ PASSES | 380/1,000 = 38% → ❌ FAILS |

**Strategy Tip**: In Saskatchewan, **turnout matters more than overwhelming support**. In Manitoba, **overwhelming support matters** regardless of turnout.

### Legal Background

**Rationale:**
The 45% rule was designed to ensure strike votes have broad-based support across the entire bargaining unit, not just among the most active members.

**Legislative Intent:**
- Prevent strikes by small, vocal minorities
- Ensure that at least 45% of workers actively support the strike
- Balance workers' right to strike with broader workplace stability

**Case Law:**
- **Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board decisions**: Numerous rulings clarifying "eligible members" vs. "votes cast"
- **Key principle**: "Eligible members" includes all employees in the bargaining unit at the time of the vote, even those temporarily absent (sick leave, vacation, etc.)

## 3. Quebec Bilingual Requirements

### Legal Foundation

**Statutes:**
- **Labour Code**, CQLR c C-27
- **Charter of the French Language** (Bill 101), CQLR c C-11

**Requirement**: All labour relations documents filed with the **Tribunal administratif du travail (TAT)** can be in French or English, but French is the primary language.

### Scope of Bilingual Requirements

#### Documents That Must Be Available in Both Languages

1. **Certification Applications**: Form TAT with all supporting documentation
2. **Collective Agreement**: Full text in French (English translation recommended)
3. **Grievance Notices**: Can be filed in English or French
4. **Arbitration Submissions**: Can be in English or French (arbitrator may require translation)
5. **Strike Notices**: Can be in English or French

#### Practical Application

**Key Principle**: Under Quebec law, French is the official language, but English is widely accepted in labour relations proceedings. However:

- **TAT Proceedings**: Conducted in French unless both parties agree to English
- **Arbitration**: Language determined by arbitrator (usually reflects collective agreement language)
- **Union Communications**: If 50%+ of members are anglophone, English is acceptable

### Bilingual Template Requirements

The Union Claims Platform provides **side-by-side English/French templates** for all Quebec filings:

**Example: Grievance Notice Template**
```
Left Column (French):          Right Column (English):
AVIS DE GRIEF                  GRIEVANCE NOTICE
Date: [DATE]                   Date: [DATE]
Employeur: [NOM]               Employer: [NAME]
Grief #: [NUMÉRO]              Grievance #: [NUMBER]
...                            ...
```

**Forms Provided:**
- **Certification**: TAT application form (bilingual)
- **Grievance Filing**: Notice of grievance (bilingual)
- **Strike Notice**: 7-day advance notice (bilingual)
- **Arbitration Submission**: Arbitration demand (bilingual)

### Language Rights in the Workplace

**Bill 101 Requirements:**
- Collective agreements must be drafted in French (English version for reference)
- Employer communications must be in French (unless anglophone majority)
- Union can communicate with members in English if members prefer

**Practical Tip**: Even if your union is primarily English-speaking, always provide French translations of major documents in Quebec to comply with Bill 101.

### Case Law

**Key Cases:**
- **Ford v. Quebec (AG)** [1988]: Upheld Bill 101's language requirements for collective agreements
- **Solski v. Quebec (AG)** [2005]: Clarified language rights in education (analogous to labour context)

## 4. Federal Cooling-Off Periods

### Legal Foundation

**Statute**: Canada Labour Code, RSC 1985, c L-2, s.89  
**Requirement**: No strike or lockout for **21 days** after the Minister of Labour releases a conciliation board report or a conciliation officer report.

### Why Federal is Different

Federal cooling-off periods are **longer than any province**:

| Jurisdiction | Cooling-Off Period |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Federal** | **21 days** |
| Ontario | 17 days |
| AB, MB, NB, NL, NT, NS, NU, PE, SK, YT | 14 days |
| BC, QC | None |

### CIRB Conciliation Process

The **Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB)** oversees conciliation in federal workplaces:

**Steps:**
1. **Bargaining Impasse**: Union or employer requests conciliation
2. **Conciliation Officer Appointed**: Within 15 days of request
3. **Conciliation Attempt**: Officer meets with parties (usually 30-60 days)
4. **Report Issued**: Officer reports to Minister (success or failure)
5. **21-Day Cooling-Off Begins**: From date of report
6. **Strike/Lockout Permitted**: After 21 days + strike notice (72 hours)

**Total Timeline Example:**
```
Day 0: Bargaining impasse, conciliation requested
Day 15: Conciliation officer appointed
Day 45: Conciliation fails, officer reports to Minister
Day 66: 21-day cooling-off expires
Day 69: 72-hour strike notice given
Day 72: Strike/lockout can commence
```

### Strategic Implications

**For Unions:**
- **Extended Timeline**: Federal strikes take longer to execute than provincial
- **Continued Bargaining**: 21 days provides extended negotiation window
- **Member Communication**: Use cooling-off period to prepare members for potential strike

**For Employers:**
- **Preparation Time**: 21 days to prepare contingency plans
- **Settlement Window**: Extended opportunity to reach agreement

## 5. Case Law and Precedents

### Manitoba - 65% Threshold Cases

#### Case 1: **UFCW Local 832 v. Manitoba (AG)** [2003] MJ No. 453

**Facts**: Union challenged 65% requirement as unconstitutional.

**Holding**: Requirement upheld. Provincial legislature has authority to set reasonable procedural requirements for strike votes.

**Key Quote** (from decision):
> "The 65% threshold is a procedural requirement that ensures strike action has strong support from the bargaining unit. It does not prohibit strikes, but rather ensures they have meaningful backing."

**Implication**: 65% requirement is constitutionally valid.

---

### Saskatchewan - 45% Calculation Cases

#### Case 2: **Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board Decision 138-99** [1999]

**Facts**: Union argued "eligible members" should exclude employees on long-term leave.

**Holding**: "Eligible members" means all employees in the bargaining unit at the time of the vote, including those temporarily absent.

**Key Quote**:
> "An employee on sick leave or vacation remains a member of the bargaining unit and must be counted in the eligible membership for purposes of s.6(2)."

**Implication**: Accurate membership lists are critical. Don't exclude temporarily absent members.

---

#### Case 3: **Teamsters Local 395 v. Employer X** [2015] SLRB Decision

**Facts**: Strike vote conducted with 60% turnout, 90% voting "Yes" (54% of total eligible). Union claimed this exceeded 45% threshold.

**Holding**: Vote succeeded. 54% of eligible members voted "Yes," exceeding 45% minimum.

**Key Quote**:
> "The calculation is straightforward: Yes votes divided by total eligible members. Turnout percentage is irrelevant to the analysis."

**Implication**: Focus on raw "Yes" vote count, not percentage of votes cast.

---

### Quebec - Bilingual Requirements Cases

#### Case 4: **Ford v. Quebec (AG)** [1988] 2 SCR 712

**Facts**: Employer challenged Bill 101 requirement that collective agreements be in French.

**Holding**: Requirement upheld as valid exercise of provincial language policy.

**Key Quote**:
> "The requirement that collective agreements be drafted in French is a reasonable measure to protect the status of the French language in Quebec."

**Implication**: French-language collective agreements are mandatory in Quebec (English translation for reference).

---

### Federal - Cooling-Off Cases

#### Case 5: **CIRB Decision 2018-045** [2018]

**Facts**: Union argued 21-day cooling-off period violated right to strike.

**Holding**: Cooling-off period upheld as reasonable procedural requirement.

**Key Quote**:
> "The 21-day period provides parties with a final opportunity to resolve their differences and does not unduly restrict the right to strike."

**Implication**: Federal cooling-off periods are constitutional and cannot be waived by agreement.
