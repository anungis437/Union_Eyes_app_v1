**Owner:** AI Governance Committee  
**Review Cycle:** Annual (or as regulations change)  
**Status:** Pending AI Governance Committee Approval

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### Policy Purpose

This AI Ethics Policy establishes clear ethical boundaries and decision-making principles for the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems at Union Eyes. It ensures that AI technologies serve workers, strengthen unions, and uphold labor movement values.

### Who This Policy Applies To

**Required Compliance:**
- All Union Eyes employees and contractors
- Third-party vendors providing AI services
- Union staff using Union Eyes AI features
- Stewards and union members (when using AI tools)

**Governance:**
- AI Governance Committee (policy oversight)
- Union Executive Board (strategic approval)
- CTO and Data Science team (implementation)

### Policy Scope

**Covered AI Systems:**
- Predictive analytics (claim outcomes, timelines, churn)
- Natural language processing (queries, document analysis)
- Recommendation systems (steward assignment, workflow)
- Generative AI (contract drafting, member communications)
- Machine learning models (all types)

**Excluded Systems:**
- Traditional software without ML/AI components
- Simple rules-based automation
- Statistical analysis without predictive models

---

## 2. Core Ethical Principles

Union Eyes AI development and deployment is guided by **six foundational principles** (see AI_PRINCIPLES.md for detailed implementation):

### Principle 1: Validity & Reliability
AI systems must be accurate, trustworthy, and fit for purpose. Claims must be evidence-based and continuously validated.

### Principle 2: Accountability
Clear responsibility for AI decisions and outcomes. Humans make final decisions on high-stakes matters. Complete audit trails required.

### Principle 3: Fairness & Bias Detection
AI must not discriminate. Regular fairness audits mandatory. Bias incidents addressed immediately with transparency.

### Principle 4: Safety & Security
Member data and systems protected from threats. Security-first design. Incident response capabilities established.

### Principle 5: Data Privacy
Member privacy is sacred. Data minimization, consent, and member rights (access, deletion, correction) strictly enforced.

### Principle 6: Explainability & Transparency
AI decisions must be explainable in plain language. No "black box" decision-making affecting members.

---

## 3. Ethical Guidelines for AI Use

### Human-Centered AI Philosophy

**Core Commitment:** AI augments human judgment, never replaces it.

**Implementation:**
- Stewards make final decisions on grievances, settlements, member advice
- AI provides recommendations, insights, predictions
- Human oversight gates for all high-stakes decisions
- Override capability always available
- "AI suggests, humans decide" messaging

**Prohibited:** Fully automated decision-making on matters materially affecting members without human review.

### Democratic Values

**Union democracy is non-negotiable.** AI must respect and enhance democratic processes.

**Requirements:**
- Member consent for AI use (especially profiling, predictions)
- Opt-out options for non-essential AI features
- Member representation on AI Governance Committee
- Transparency reports to membership (annual minimum)
- No AI use to suppress dissent or manipulate union elections

**Prohibited:**
- AI surveillance of organizing activities without consent
- Predictive modeling of member voting behavior for manipulation
- AI-generated communications misrepresenting union positions
- Suppression of member speech or democratic participation

### Solidarity & Collective Action

**AI must strengthen, not undermine, worker solidarity.**

**Requirements:**
- AI tools available to all unions/members equitably (no "premium AI")
- Training and support provided to all users
- Data not shared across unions without explicit consent
- AI benefits shared collectively (efficiency gains = more member service)

**Prohibited:**
- Using AI to identify "troublemakers" for employer retaliation
- Profiling members for union disengagement (without intervention context)
- Creating competitive advantages for specific unions over others
- AI replacing workers without retraining/redeployment

### Worker Empowerment

**AI should empower workers, not create dependency or deskilling.**

**Requirements:**
- Training emphasizes critical thinking alongside AI tool use
- Stewards maintain core skills (legal research, case assessment)
- AI limitations clearly communicated (no overreliance)
- Regular skill assessments and refresher training

**Prohibited:**
- Allowing complete loss of traditional union skills
- Making AI tools so complex they exclude less tech-savvy users
- Creating AI dependency that leaves unions helpless if system fails

---

## 4. Prohibited AI Uses

### Absolute Prohibitions

Union Eyes will **never** develop or deploy AI for:

#### 1. Surveillance & Retaliation
- **Prohibited:** AI monitoring member social media to identify union critics
- **Prohibited:** Predictive models identifying "flight risk" members for retaliation or reduced services
- **Prohibited:** Tracking member organizing activities on behalf of employers
- **Prohibited:** Facial recognition or biometric tracking without explicit consent

#### 2. Manipulation & Deception
- **Prohibited:** AI-generated deepfakes or synthetic media impersonating real people
- **Prohibited:** Manipulative "dark patterns" in AI interfaces to coerce decisions
- **Prohibited:** AI chatbots misrepresenting themselves as human stewards
- **Prohibited:** Selective AI recommendations biased toward union's financial interests over member welfare

#### 3. Discrimination
- **Prohibited:** AI trained on biased data not corrected for fairness
- **Prohibited:** Models optimized for accuracy without fairness constraints
- **Prohibited:** Deployment of AI with known discriminatory outcomes
- **Prohibited:** Using protected attributes (race, gender, age, etc.) as direct features except when legally required (affirmative action)

#### 4. Harm to Workers
- **Prohibited:** AI used to justify layoffs or replacement of union staff/stewards
- **Prohibited:** Automated discipline or termination recommendations for union employees
- **Prohibited:** Sharing member data with employers without consent (except as legally required)
- **Prohibited:** AI optimizing employer outcomes at member expense (e.g., recommending low settlements to close cases faster)

#### 5. Violations of Rights
- **Prohibited:** AI overriding member data rights (access, deletion, correction)
- **Prohibited:** Processing member data for purposes beyond those consented to
- **Prohibited:** AI decisions affecting members without explanation capability
- **Prohibited:** Sharing member data with third parties for non-union purposes (marketing, political campaigns)

### Conditional Prohibitions (Require Special Approval)

These AI uses are **presumed prohibited** unless AI Governance Committee grants specific approval with safeguards:

#### 1. Organizing Campaign Intelligence (UC-13)
- **Risk:** Could enable surveillance or manipulation
- **Approval Required:** AI Governance Committee supermajority + ethics board review + member input
- **Safeguards:** Must demonstrate benefit outweighs risk, strict transparency, opt-in only

#### 2. Predictive Member Profiling
- **Risk:** Churn prediction could feel invasive
- **Approval Required:** Privacy impact assessment, opt-out option, fairness audit
- **Safeguards:** Used only for proactive member support, not punishment

#### 3. Automated Member Communications
- **Risk:** Impersonal, error-prone, could damage trust
- **Approval Required:** Human review, clear "AI-generated" labeling, opt-out available
- **Safeguards:** Used for routine updates only (deadlines, confirmations), not sensitive matters

#### 4. AI-Assisted Negotiation Strategy
- **Risk:** Could recommend suboptimal outcomes for efficiency
- **Approval Required:** Human negotiator oversight, member approval of AI involvement
- **Safeguards:** AI provides data/comparisons only, humans make all negotiation decisions

#### 5. Cross-Union Data Analysis
- **Risk:** Privacy violation if data shared without consent
- **Approval Required:** Explicit consent from all unions involved, anonymization
- **Safeguards:** Aggregate analysis only, no individual union/member identification

## 5. Ethical Decision-Making Framework

When ethical dilemmas arise, use this **four-step framework**:

### Step 1: Identify the Ethical Issue

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does this AI use affect member rights, privacy, fairness, or safety?
- Could this AI use be perceived as surveillance, manipulation, or discrimination?
- Are there competing interests (efficiency vs. privacy, accuracy vs. fairness)?
- Does this violate any absolute prohibition?

**Example Dilemma:**  
*"Should we use churn prediction AI to identify at-risk members?"*

**Ethical Issues:**
- Privacy: Profiling members without explicit consent
- Autonomy: Members unaware they're being predicted
- Fairness: Could predictions be biased by demographics?
- Benefit: Early intervention could save memberships

### Step 2: Apply Ethical Principles

Evaluate the AI use against our six principles:

| Principle | Question | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Validity** | Is churn prediction accurate enough (>75%) to be useful? | ✅ Models tested at 82% accuracy |
| **Accountability** | Who decides how to intervene with at-risk members? | ✅ Human steward makes outreach decision |
| **Fairness** | Could predictions be biased by race, age, gender? | ⚠️ Requires fairness audit before deployment |
| **Safety** | Could this data be misused or breached? | ⚠️ Must ensure data security, no employer access |
| **Privacy** | Is member consent obtained? Are data rights respected? | ❌ Need opt-out option, transparency |
| **Explainability** | Can we explain to members why they were flagged? | ✅ Risk factors can be communicated |

### Step 3: Consult Stakeholders

**Who to Consult:**
- Members (surveys, focus groups, town halls)
- Stewards (those who will use AI or be affected)
- Legal counsel (compliance, liability)
- AI Governance Committee (formal approval)
- External ethicists (complex cases)

**Churn Prediction Example Consultation:**
- Survey 100 members: "Would you want proactive outreach if union detected you might leave?"
  - Result: 78% said yes if anonymous and voluntary
- Steward focus group: "Is this helpful or creepy?"
  - Result: Helpful if framed as "early support," not surveillance
- Legal review: Privacy law compliance?
  - Result: Requires opt-out option and transparency

### Step 4: Make Decision with Safeguards

**Decision Matrix:**

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Clear Ethical Approval** | Proceed with standard governance approval |
| **Ethical with Safeguards** | Implement with specific risk mitigations |
| **Ethically Uncertain** | Pilot test, gather feedback, reassess |
| **Ethically Problematic** | Do not proceed; revisit if circumstances change |

**Churn Prediction Decision:**  
✅ **Approved with Safeguards:**
- Explicit opt-out option (default opt-in with clear disclosure)
- Fairness audit before deployment (quarterly ongoing)
- Used only for proactive member support (no punishment)
- 1-year data retention limit (then delete predictions)
- Transparency: Members told "We use AI to identify at-risk members for early support"
- Explainability: If member asks, explain risk factors (engagement drop, missed payments, complaints)

### Escalation Process

**Level 1:** AI/Product team identifies ethical issue → Internal ethics discussion  
**Level 2:** Uncertain or medium-risk → AI Governance Committee review  
**Level 3:** High-risk or controversial → Committee supermajority + external ethicist  
**Level 4:** Fundamental policy question → Union Executive Board approval  
**Level 5:** Major member rights issue → Membership referendum
