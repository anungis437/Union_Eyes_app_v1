## Module 1: AI Basics for Union Stewards (45 minutes)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand what AI is (and isn't)
- Explain how AI is used in Union Eyes
- Recognize AI's strengths and limitations

### Content Outline

**1.1 What is AI? (15 minutes)**

**Simple Definition:**
> "AI is a computer program that learns patterns from past data to make predictions or recommendations about new situations."

**Key Concepts (explain with union examples):**

- **Machine Learning:** Computer learns from examples (like a steward learning from past cases)
  - *Example:* AI reads 10,000 past grievances to learn what makes a case winnable

- **Predictions:** AI estimates what will happen (not crystal ball, educated guess)
  - *Example:* "This grievance has 85% chance of winning based on similar past cases"

- **Training Data:** Past cases AI learned from (quality matters!)
  - *Example:* If AI only learned from 2020-2023, it may not know about new employer tactics

- **Pattern Recognition:** AI finds similarities (like humans, but faster)
  - *Example:* AI notices "grievances with witness statements win 20% more often"

**What AI is NOT:**

- ❌ Not magic or perfect
- ❌ Not conscious or thinking like humans
- ❌ Not a replacement for steward judgment
- ❌ Not always right (can be biased or make mistakes)

**Activity (5 min):** Poll participants - "Have you used AI before?" (ChatGPT, Siri, Netflix recommendations). Connect to familiar examples.

**1.2 AI in Union Eyes (15 minutes)**

**Six Core AI Features:**

1. **Claim Outcome Predictor** (UC-01)
   - What it does: Predicts win/lose probability
   - When to use: Case assessment, settlement decisions
   - Accuracy: ~87% (not 100%!)

2. **Timeline Forecaster** (UC-02)
   - What it does: Estimates resolution time
   - When to use: Managing member expectations
   - Accuracy: ±10 days average

3. **Legal Precedent Search** (UC-03)
   - What it does: Finds similar past cases
   - When to use: Building case arguments
   - Accuracy: Relevant results in top 5 usually

4. **NLP Query Engine** (UC-04)
   - What it does: Answer questions in plain English
   - When to use: Quick data lookup ("How many overtime grievances this year?")
   - Accuracy: ~89%

5. **Document Analyzer** (UC-05)
   - What it does: Summarizes contracts, policies
   - When to use: Reviewing long documents quickly
   - Accuracy: Good for summaries, verify details

6. **Steward Recommender** (UC-06)
   - What it does: Suggests best steward for case
   - When to use: Assigning cases
   - Accuracy: ~78% acceptance rate

**Activity (10 min):** Watch 3-minute demo video showing each feature in action.

**1.3 AI Strengths & Limitations (15 minutes)**

**AI is Good At:**
✅ Processing large amounts of data quickly  
✅ Finding patterns humans might miss  
✅ Consistent (doesn't get tired or emotional)  
✅ Freeing up steward time for member interaction

**AI is Bad At:**
❌ Understanding context and nuance  
❌ Handling unusual or unprecedented situations  
❌ Empathy and emotional intelligence  
❌ Ethical judgment and union values  
❌ Explaining its reasoning (sometimes a "black box")

**Real Example - When AI Failed:**
> "In 2024 pilot, AI predicted a discrimination case would lose (40% win probability). Steward trusted their gut, took it to arbitration anyway, and won. Why? AI didn't account for recent shift in arbitrator attitudes. **Lesson: AI is a tool, not your boss.**"

**Discussion (5 min):** "When would you trust AI? When would you ignore it?"

## Module 2: Using AI Features Hands-On (90 minutes)

### Learning Objectives

- Navigate AI features in Union Eyes dashboard
- Interpret AI predictions correctly
- Use AI to improve case workflow

### Content Outline

**2.1 Demo System Setup (5 minutes)**

- Log in to Union Eyes training environment
- Verify AI features visible (green toggle)
- Test case scenarios pre-loaded

**2.2 Feature Walkthrough & Practice (75 minutes total, ~12 min per feature)**

**Feature 1: Claim Outcome Predictor (15 minutes)**

**Walkthrough (7 min):**

1. Open test grievance case (#TRAIN-001)
2. Navigate to "AI Insights" tab
3. View prediction: "72% Win Probability"
4. Expand "Explanation" section
5. Review key factors:
   - ✅ Strong evidence (witness statements)
   - ✅ Clear contract violation (Article 12.3)
   - ⚠️ Employer has strong past-practice defense
6. Check "Similar Cases" (5 past cases with outcomes)

**Key Points:**

- Percentage is probability, not certainty (72% means 28% chance of losing)
- Always read the explanation (what factors AI considered)
- Green ✅ = factors helping case, Red ⚠️ = factors hurting case
- Review similar cases to validate prediction

**Practice Exercise (8 min):**

- Open cases #TRAIN-002, #TRAIN-003
- For each: Record prediction, identify top 3 factors, assess: Trust AI or investigate further?
- Discuss answers with partner

**Feature 2: Timeline Forecaster (12 minutes)**

**Walkthrough (5 min):**

1. Open test case (#TRAIN-004)
2. View "Estimated Resolution: 42 days"
3. Expand timeline breakdown:
   - Grievance filing → Step 1: 5 days
   - Step 1 → Step 2: 12 days
   - Step 2 → Arbitration: 18 days
   - Arbitration → Decision: 7 days
4. Note confidence: "Medium (±10 days)"

**Key Points:**

- Estimate is based on average past cases (not guaranteed)
- Use for member communication ("Expect resolution in 4-6 weeks")
- Red flag if delays exceed estimate by 2+ weeks (follow up!)

**Practice Exercise (7 min):**

- Open case #TRAIN-005
- Use timeline estimate to draft member update email
- Share with group

**Feature 3: Legal Precedent Search (12 minutes)**

**Walkthrough (5 min):**

1. From case #TRAIN-001, click "Find Similar Cases"
2. Review top 5 results (sorted by relevance)
3. For each result, see:
   - Case summary (2-3 sentences)
   - Outcome (Won/Lost/Settled)
   - Similarity score (85% match)
   - Key quotes from arbitrator decision
4. Click into full case details

**Key Points:**

- Results ranked by similarity (top results most relevant)
- Read summaries first, dive into details for best matches
- Look for arbitrator reasoning (why case won/lost)
- Use quotes in your grievance arguments

**Practice Exercise (7 min):**

- Search for precedents on "overtime pay dispute"
- Find 3 cases supporting your position
- Draft one paragraph using precedent

**Feature 4: NLP Query Engine (10 minutes)**

**Walkthrough (4 min):**

1. Click "Ask a Question" in dashboard
2. Type natural language query: "How many termination grievances did we win in 2024?"
3. AI converts to database query (shows SQL if interested)
4. Returns answer: "18 won, 7 lost, 3 settled (64% win rate)"
5. Click "See Details" for list of cases

**Key Points:**

- Ask questions like you'd ask a coworker (natural language)
- AI handles complex queries (multiple filters, date ranges)
- If AI doesn't understand, rephrase question
- Always verify critical numbers (click "See Details")

**Practice Exercise (6 min):**

- Ask 3 questions about training data:
  1. "What's our average case resolution time?"
  2. "Which steward handled the most cases last quarter?"
  3. "How many discrimination cases are currently open?"
- Compare answers with actual data

**Feature 5: Document Analyzer (12 minutes)**

**Walkthrough (5 min):**

1. Upload test document (CBA excerpt - 50 pages)
2. AI generates summary (2-page overview)
3. Review extracted key points:
   - Overtime rules (Article 8)
   - Discipline procedures (Article 14)
   - Grievance process (Article 18)
4. Ask follow-up: "What does Article 8.3 say about mandatory overtime?"
5. AI quotes relevant section

**Key Points:**

- Saves time on long documents (read summary first)
- Still read full text for critical details (don't skip entirely)
- Use for quick reference during meetings
- AI may miss nuanced language (verify important clauses)

**Practice Exercise (7 min):**

- Upload practice CBA
- Generate summary
- Ask 2 follow-up questions
- Verify one answer against actual CBA text

**Feature 6: Steward Recommender (12 minutes)**

**Walkthrough (5 min):**

1. Open new unassigned case (#TRAIN-007)
2. Click "Suggest Steward"
3. AI recommends top 3 stewards:
   - **Sarah M.** (85% match) - Experience with similar cases (12), low workload (3 active cases)
   - **Tom K.** (78% match) - High win rate on this issue type (89%), available this week
   - **Maria L.** (72% match) - Expert in this contract article, moderate workload (6 cases)
4. Expand explanation for each recommendation

**Key Points:**

- AI considers expertise, workload, availability, past success
- Top recommendation isn't always best (consider personal factors AI can't see)
- Override if you know steward is on vacation, handling personal issue, etc.
- Helps balance workload across team

**Practice Exercise (7 min):**

- Review 3 case assignments
- For each: Accept AI recommendation or override? Why?
- Discuss group: "What factors should AI NOT consider?" (e.g., race, gender)

**2.3 Integration Exercise (10 minutes)**

**Scenario:** New grievance intake (test case #TRAIN-009)

**Task:** Use ALL AI features in workflow:

1. ✅ Predict outcome (should we pursue or settle early?)
2. ✅ Estimate timeline (set member expectations)
3. ✅ Search precedents (build case strategy)
4. ✅ Assign steward (who's best fit?)
5. ✅ Analyze relevant CBA section (understand rights)

**Debrief (5 min):** How did AI save time? Where did you still need human judgment?

## Module 3: Responsible AI & Critical Thinking (60 minutes)

### Learning Objectives

- Identify bias risks in AI systems
- Apply human oversight effectively
- Know when to distrust AI

### Content Outline

**3.1 Why Responsible AI Matters (15 minutes)**

**Union Values & AI:**

- ✊ **Solidarity:** AI should help ALL members fairly (no discrimination)
- ⚖️ **Justice:** AI must not perpetuate employer bias
- 🛡️ **Protection:** Members' data must be private and secure
- 💪 **Empowerment:** AI should amplify steward power, not replace it

**Real Risks:**

1. **Algorithmic Bias:** AI learns from biased past data
   - *Example:* If past arbitrators were biased against women, AI may learn to predict women's grievances will lose (even if unfair)

2. **Privacy Breaches:** Sensitive member data could leak
   - *Example:* Medical info, disciplinary records, salary data

3. **Over-Reliance:** Stewards stop thinking critically
   - *Example:* AI says 95% win, steward doesn't investigate, misses fatal flaw

4. **Opacity:** AI is a "black box" (hard to explain decisions to members)
   - *Example:* Member asks "Why did AI say I'll lose?" → Hard to explain

**Activity (5 min):** Brainstorm - "What could go wrong if we trust AI too much?"

**3.2 Detecting Bias in AI (20 minutes)**

**Types of Bias to Watch For:**

**1. Demographic Bias (most serious)**

- **Definition:** AI treats members differently based on race, gender, age, disability
- **Example:** AI predicts Black members' grievances will lose more often (even controlling for case facts)
- **Red Flags:**
  - Predictions consistently lower for certain demographic groups
  - "Similar cases" don't actually look similar (different race/gender)
  - Explanations mention demographic factors (SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN - report immediately!)

**2. Recency Bias**

- **Definition:** AI over-weights recent data, ignores long-term trends
- **Example:** If last 10 cases lost, AI predicts all future cases will lose (ignores 90% win rate historically)
- **Red Flags:**
  - Predictions shift dramatically after short losing streak
  - AI doesn't account for temporary factors (new employer lawyer, arbitrator on vacation)

**3. Employer Bias**

- **Definition:** AI learns employer's past success, assumes it will continue
- **Example:** If employer usually wins at Step 1, AI assumes they'll always win (ignores bad employer arguments)
- **Red Flags:**
  - AI over-predicts employer wins
  - Explanations cite "employer's past success" without analyzing current case merits

**4. Proxy Discrimination**

- **Definition:** AI uses factors correlated with demographics as proxies
- **Example:** AI uses "zip code" to predict outcomes → zip code correlates with race → indirect discrimination
- **Red Flags:**
  - Predictions vary by factors that shouldn't matter (location, shift, seniority in ways that correlate with demographics)

**How to Detect Bias (Practical Steps):**

1. **Compare Across Groups:** Track AI accuracy for different demographic groups
   - If AI is 90% accurate for white members but 75% for Black members → BIAS

2. **Question Low Predictions:** When AI says low win probability, ask "Why?"
   - If explanation doesn't make sense or cites stereotypes → DISTRUST

3. **Review Similar Cases:** Are they actually similar in relevant ways?
   - If "similar" cases differ by race/gender but AI claims similarity → RED FLAG

4. **Report Suspicions:** If you suspect bias, report to Data Science team immediately
   - Email: <ai-fairness@unioneyes.org>
   - Don't ignore your gut - bias is serious!

**Case Study (10 min):**
> **Scenario:** AI predicts a 55% win probability for a sexual harassment grievance filed by a woman. Similar case (same contract violation, similar evidence) filed by a man last month got 78% prediction.
>
> **Questions:**
>
> 1. Is this potential bias? (YES - same facts, different prediction by gender)
> 2. What should steward do? (Report to AI team, investigate further, don't rely on AI for this case)
> 3. How should this be investigated? (Fairness audit, review all harassment cases by gender)

**Activity (5 min):** Review 3 test cases, identify which shows potential bias.

**3.3 Human Oversight: When to Override AI (15 minutes)**

**Decision Framework: Trust or Override?**

**TRUST AI when:**
✅ Prediction aligns with your assessment  
✅ Explanation makes sense (cites relevant factors)  
✅ Similar cases are actually similar  
✅ No red flags (bias, errors, missing context)  
✅ Low-stakes decision (research, informational)

**OVERRIDE AI when:**
❌ Prediction contradicts your experience/knowledge  
❌ Explanation is vague or cites irrelevant factors  
❌ AI missed important context (recent law change, new employer policy)  
❌ Potential bias detected  
❌ High-stakes decision (termination, discrimination, member's livelihood)  
❌ Member strongly disagrees (they know their situation best)

**Examples:**

**Scenario 1:** AI predicts 85% win for overtime grievance. You reviewed case, agree. Evidence is strong, clear contract violation.
→ **TRUST AI** ✅ (but still do your due diligence)

**Scenario 2:** AI predicts 40% win for discipline grievance. But you know the member has exemplary record for 20 years, employer has vendetta. AI explanation doesn't mention member's record.
→ **OVERRIDE AI** ❌ (AI missed important context)

**Scenario 3:** AI recommends assigning case to Steward X. But you know Steward X is dealing with family emergency this week.
→ **OVERRIDE AI** ❌ (AI doesn't know personal circumstances)

**Scenario 4:** AI predicts 90% win. You're still doing full investigation, but it boosts your confidence.
→ **USE AI AS CONFIRMATION** ✅ (not replacement for your work)

**Golden Rule:**
> **"AI is your assistant, not your boss. You have final say. Always."**

**Activity (10 min):** Role-play scenarios - participants decide: trust or override AI?

**3.4 Data Privacy & Security (10 minutes)**

**What Data Does AI See?**

- Case facts (grievance type, contract articles, evidence)
- Member demographics (for fairness monitoring ONLY - not used in predictions)
- Outcome data (win/lose, settlement amounts)
- CBA texts, policies, past arbitrator decisions

**What Data Does AI NOT See?**

- Member names (pseudonymized in training data)
- Social Security Numbers, bank accounts
- Personal health information (HIPAA protected)
- Communications with members (emails, messages)

**Your Responsibilities:**

1. **Don't input unnecessary PII:** When describing case, use "member" not names
2. **Secure your login:** AI access tied to your Union Eyes account
3. **Don't share screen with sensitive data:** In public, on Zoom calls
4. **Report suspicious activity:** Unauthorized access, data leaks

**If Data Breach Occurs:**

- Contact CTO immediately: [cto@unioneyes.org](mailto:cto@unioneyes.org)
- Preserve evidence (don't delete anything)
- Follow [AI_INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md](AI_INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md)

## Module 4: Practical Scenarios & Troubleshooting (45 minutes)

### Learning Objectives

- Apply AI features to real-world scenarios
- Troubleshoot common problems
- Know when to escalate

### Content Outline

**4.1 Real-World Scenarios (25 minutes)**

**Scenario 1: Overwhelming Caseload (5 min)**

**Situation:** You have 15 open grievances, can't keep up. How can AI help?

**AI Solutions:**

- ✅ Use Timeline Forecaster to prioritize (which cases need attention now?)
- ✅ Use NLP Query to quickly check status ("Which of my cases haven't had activity in 30+ days?")
- ✅ Use Steward Recommender to redistribute cases (workload balancing)
- ✅ Use Document Analyzer to quickly review CBAs instead of reading 50 pages

**Discussion:** How else could AI save you time?

**Scenario 2: New Type of Grievance (5 min)**

**Situation:** First time handling AI/automation grievance (employer replacing workers with robots). No past cases. AI prediction uncertain (52% win).

**What to Do:**

- ❌ Don't rely on AI (no training data for this issue)
- ✅ Use Legal Precedent Search for related issues (technology, job elimination)
- ✅ Consult with experienced stewards, labor lawyers
- ✅ Treat as test case (AI will learn from outcome for future)

**Lesson:** AI is only as good as its training data. Novel situations = limited AI help.

**Scenario 3: Member Challenges AI Prediction (5 min)**

**Situation:** AI predicts 35% win. Member insists case is strong, demands you pursue. What do you do?

**Response:**

1. **Explain AI limitation:** "AI is based on past cases, but every case is unique. It's a tool, not a decision-maker."
2. **Investigate thoroughly:** Don't let AI override member's perspective. They know their situation.
3. **Review explanation:** What factors did AI cite? Are they accurate?
4. **Make YOUR judgment:** If you agree with member, pursue case. Document your reasoning.
5. **Report outcome:** If case wins despite low AI prediction, tell Data Science team (helps improve AI)

**Lesson:** Member voice matters most. AI supports, doesn't replace.

**Scenario 4: AI Seems Wrong (5 min)**

**Situation:** AI predicts 88% win for termination case. But you notice employer has new aggressive lawyer who's won last 5 cases. AI explanation doesn't mention this.

**What to Do:**

- ❌ Don't blindly trust 88% prediction
- ✅ Override AI (your local knowledge > AI's historical data)
- ✅ Report to Data Science team: "AI not accounting for new employer lawyer"
- ✅ Prepare member for possible loss despite high prediction
- ✅ Consider settlement if employer offers reasonable terms

**Lesson:** AI can't predict future changes (new lawyers, new arbitrators, new laws). Your judgment essential.

**Scenario 5: Potential Bias Detected (5 min)**

**Situation:** You notice AI consistently predicts lower win rates for women's discrimination grievances compared to men's. (Women: avg 62%, Men: avg 79% for similar facts)

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

1. **Stop relying on AI for these cases** (use human judgment only)
2. **Document pattern:** Take screenshots, note case IDs
3. **Report to AI Fairness Team:** <ai-fairness@unioneyes.org> (urgent!)
4. **Notify supervisor and CTO**
5. **Inform AI Governance Committee**

**What Happens Next:**

- Data Science team investigates (usually 1-2 days)
- If bias confirmed, AI model taken offline for retraining
- Fairness audit conducted
- All affected cases reviewed
- Members notified if bias impacted their case

**Lesson:** Bias is serious. Report immediately. Don't ignore.

**4.2 Troubleshooting Common Issues (15 minutes)**

## Module 5: Q&A, Assessment & Certification (40 minutes)

### Content Outline

**5.1 Open Q&A (15 minutes)**

Participants ask any remaining questions. Trainer addresses concerns.

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Will AI replace stewards?**
A: Absolutely not. AI is a tool to make your job easier, not replace you. Members need human advocates with empathy, judgment, and union values. AI can't do that.

**Q: What if I don't trust AI?**
A: That's healthy skepticism! You don't have to use AI features if you're uncomfortable. They're optional tools. But understanding AI helps you evaluate it critically.

**Q: How often is AI retrained?**
A: Currently quarterly (every 3 months) or when significant drift detected. Future: automated retraining when accuracy drops.

**Q: Can employers access our AI predictions?**
A: No. Union Eyes is our system, not shared with employers. Employer has no access to our data or AI insights.

**Q: What happens to my data after a case closes?**
A: Case data retained for 7 years (regulatory requirement), then archived or deleted. Used to train AI only with pseudonymization (no names).

**Q: I found an error in AI prediction. What do I do?**
A: Great! Report it to <ai-support@unioneyes.org> with case ID and details. Helps us improve AI for everyone.

- ✅ Confirm participants (15-20 ideal, max 25)
- ✅ Print workbooks (one per participant + 2 extra)
- ✅ Print certificates (blank, fill in names after)
- ✅ Test demo system (all features working?)
- ✅ Load test cases (TRAIN-001 through TRAIN-009)
- ✅ Prepare assessment (print or online quiz)

- **Address concerns:** Some participants may fear job loss (reassure!)
- **Keep energy up:** Break every 60-75 minutes
- **Relate to their experience:** "You already do this when you [X], AI just speeds it up"

**Handling Difficult Participants:**

- **Skeptic:** "I don't trust technology" → Validate concerns, emphasize AI is optional tool
- **Over-Enthusiast:** "AI will solve everything!" → Temper expectations, emphasize limitations
- **Disengaged:** Checking phone, not participating → Ask direct questions, relate to their work
