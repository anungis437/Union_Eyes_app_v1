## Slide 10: Risks & Mitigations

### Top 5 Risks to 90% Completion

**1. Committee Formation Delay** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Very High)

- **Risk:** Board does not approve today → 4-6 week delay → Q1 slips to Q2
- **Impact:** Cannot approve policies, cannot deploy use cases, cascade delays
- **Mitigation:**
  - Backup member candidates identified (ready to recruit)
  - External advisor pre-vetted (can start immediately)
  - Charter complete, ready for Day 1 meeting
- **Ask:** Board approval today (January 10) to meet January 15 first meeting

**2. Fairness Audit Failure** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)

- **Risk:** First audit reveals bias in Claim Outcome Prediction → model retraining required
- **Impact:** 30-60 day delay, reputational risk, member complaints
- **Mitigation:**
  - 30-day remediation buffer built into schedule
  - Pre-audit bias testing (in progress)
  - External auditor with union experience (RFP requirement)
  - Model performance monitoring (85% accuracy threshold)

**3. Low Adoption (<40%)** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)

- **Risk:** Stewards don't use AI tools despite training → ROI not realized
- **Impact:** $912K investment with limited business value
- **Mitigation:**
  - Gamification (leaderboards, badges, recognition)
  - Champions program (20 AI evangelists)
  - Mandatory training pathway (tied to professional development)
  - Continuous feedback loops (monthly surveys)
  - Leadership endorsement (Board, union leaders)

**4. Budget Overruns** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium)

- **Risk:** Use case development takes longer than estimated → cost overruns
- **Impact:** Need additional $100K+ mid-year
- **Mitigation:**
  - 10% contingency ($91K) built into budget
  - Phased deployment (can delay UC-12, UC-14 if needed)
  - Scope reduction options (MVP features first)
  - Monthly budget reviews with CTO

**5. Use Case Deployment Delays** (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium)

- **Risk:** Complex use cases (UC-09 Grievance Drafting, UC-10 Negotiation) slip schedules
- **Impact:** Q2 milestones miss 70% target, cascade to Q3
- **Mitigation:**
  - Parallel development tracks (3 use cases simultaneously)
  - Scope reduction for complex features (MVP approach)
  - Adjust roadmap (swap UC-12/UC-14 for simpler use cases if needed)
  - Weekly sprint reviews with Product Manager

- Positive ROI in Year 1, compounding in Years 2-3

**3. Thought Leadership:**

- Speaking opportunities at labor conferences
- Press coverage ("The Union Leading on Ethical AI")
- Policy influence (union perspective in AI regulation debates)
- Recruitment advantage (attract tech-savvy organizers)

**4. Collective Action:**

- Share learnings with sister unions (open-source approach)
- Build coalition for labor-focused AI standards
- Counter employer AI surveillance with worker-empowering AI

---

## Slide 13: What We're Asking For Today

### Board Decisions Required (January 10, 2026)

**1. APPROVE: AI Governance Committee Formation** ✋ **CRITICAL**

- Authorize CTO to recruit 7 committee members
- Approve committee charter (attached)
- Authorize $50K annual committee budget
- Target first meeting: January 15, 2026 (5 days from today)

**Why this is urgent:** Without committee, cannot approve policies → cannot deploy use cases → Q1 milestones slip 4-6 weeks → 90% target at risk

**2. APPROVE: $912K AI Implementation Budget (2026)**

- Revised from $535K original budget (+$377K increase)
- Breakdown: $285K (Q1) + $312K (Q2) + $315K (Q3)
- Funding sources: [Budget allocations to be confirmed]
- ROI: $1.08M annual value (118% return)

**Why this is necessary:** Original $535K budget was for maintenance, not growth. 90% completion requires 7 new use cases, 180 additional stewards trained, 3.2 FTE hires, external audits.

**3. ENDORSE: 90% Completion Target (Q3 2026)**

- Public commitment to achieving 90% by September 30, 2026
- Quarterly Board reviews (March, June, September)
- CTO accountability for delivery

**Why this matters:** Board endorsement signals strategic priority, enables CTO to make execution decisions, aligns organization.

### What Happens After Approval

**January 13-15 (Week 1):**

- CTO recruits 7 committee members
- ML Engineer job posted
- Steward training pilot scheduled
- External auditor RFP released

**January 15 (Day 5):**

- First AI Governance Committee meeting
- Charter ratified
- Q1 priorities confirmed
- Policy review begins

**January 31 (Week 4):**

- 10 stewards trained (pilot complete)
- AI Ethics Policy draft ready for committee review
- Monitoring dashboard development 50% complete

**March 31 (End of Q1):**

- **50% completion achieved**
- 50 stewards trained
- 2 new use cases deployed
- 2 policies approved
- First fairness audit complete

---

## Slide 14: Q&A - Anticipated Questions

### Question 1: "Why can't we do this with the original $535K budget?"

**Answer:** The original budget was for **maintenance**, not **growth**. It covered:

- Infrastructure costs ($150K Azure, licensing)
- Existing staff salaries ($210K)
- Ongoing operations ($175K)

To advance from 35% → 90%, we need:

- **7 new use cases** ($350K development)
- **180 additional stewards trained** ($90K training delivery)
- **3.2 FTE hires** ($360K prorated for 2026)
- **External audits** ($40K fairness, $35K security)
- **Governance committee** ($50K operations)

The $377K increase is a **strategic investment**, not a cost overrun. ROI is 118% in Year 1.

---

### Question 2: "What if the committee finds bias in our AI models?"

**Answer:** **This is exactly why we need the committee.**

**Scenario:** Q2 fairness audit reveals 8% bias in Claim Outcome Prediction (favoring certain demographics).

**Our Response (30-day remediation):**

1. **Immediate:** Suspend affected predictions, notify impacted members
2. **Week 1:** Root cause analysis (data imbalance? feature selection? model architecture?)
3. **Week 2-3:** Model retraining with balanced dataset, bias detection algorithms
4. **Week 4:** Re-audit, validate bias eliminated, resume predictions
5. **Ongoing:** Add continuous bias monitoring, quarterly re-audits

**Transparent Communication:**

- Notify members: "We discovered and fixed a bias issue"
- Explain remediation: "Here's what we did to ensure fairness"
- Demonstrate accountability: "We're committed to ethical AI"

**Result:** Increased trust (we caught it and fixed it) vs. decreased trust (we ignored it and got exposed).

**The alternative (no governance):** Bias goes undetected → member lawsuit → union reputation damaged → regulatory scrutiny → forced to shut down AI program.

---

### Question 3: "What if adoption stays low (<30%) despite training?"

**Answer:** Low adoption is a **risk we take seriously**. Here's our mitigation strategy:

**Diagnosis (Month 3 - March 2026):**

- Survey stewards: Why aren't you using AI? (Fear? Usability? Lack of value?)
- Usage analytics: Which features are used? Which are ignored?
- Focus groups: What would make AI more valuable to your work?

**Interventions (Months 4-6):**

1. **Gamification:** Leaderboards, badges, public recognition for AI usage
2. **Champions Program:** Recruit 20 "AI evangelists" (peer influence)
3. **Mandatory Training:** Tie AI certification to professional development requirements
4. **Simplify UX:** Remove friction, integrate into existing workflows
5. **Leadership Endorsement:** Union leaders publicly use and promote AI tools

**Success Stories:** Highlight early adopters (e.g., "Steward Jane resolved 15 grievances in 30 days using AI-assisted research")

**Escalation (Month 6):** If still <30%, adjust roadmap:

- Pause new use case development
- Focus 100% on adoption (UX improvements, training, communication)
- Delay Q3 milestones until adoption reaches 40%+

**Rationale:** Technology without users = wasted investment. Better to have 5 highly-adopted use cases than 12 ignored ones.

---

### Question 4: "How do we know the AI won't replace stewards?"

**Answer:** **AI is designed to augment stewards, not replace them.**

**What AI Does:**

- ✅ Reads 50,000 documents in seconds (legal research)
- ✅ Predicts claim outcomes based on historical data
- ✅ Drafts initial grievance language (steward edits)
- ✅ Flags members at churn risk (steward intervenes)

**What AI Cannot Do:**

- ❌ Build trust with members (requires human empathy)
- ❌ Navigate workplace politics (requires emotional intelligence)
- ❌ Make ethical judgments (requires human values)
- ❌ Negotiate with employers (requires human persuasion)
- ❌ Provide emotional support (requires human connection)

**The Steward Role Evolution:**

**Before AI:**

- 70% administrative (paperwork, research, data entry)
- 30% member interaction (listening, advocating, supporting)

**After AI:**

- 30% administrative (review AI outputs, approve decisions)
- 70% member interaction (more time for human connection)

**Result:** Stewards spend **more time** doing what they do best (helping members) and **less time** on tasks machines do better (data processing).

**Analogy:** Calculators didn't replace accountants. They made accountants more productive and let them focus on strategy instead of arithmetic. AI is the calculator for stewards.

---

### Question 5: "What happens if we don't approve this today?"

**Answer:** **We remain stuck at 35% completion indefinitely.**

**Without Board Approval:**

**Immediate (January):**

- ❌ Cannot form AI Governance Committee → Cannot approve policies
- ❌ Cannot post ML Engineer job → Hiring delayed 4-6 weeks
- ❌ Cannot deploy advanced use cases → Stuck with 5 basic features
- ❌ Cannot conduct fairness audits → Ethical risk exposure

**Q1 2026 (January-March):**

- ❌ Miss 50% completion target (remain at 35%)
- ❌ No new use cases deployed (Churn Risk, Workload Forecasting delayed)
- ❌ No steward training at scale (remain at 20 trained)
- ❌ $285K Q1 budget unspent, projects paused

**Q2-Q3 2026 (April-September):**

- ❌ Cascade delays: Q2 slips to Q3, Q3 slips to Q4/2027
- ❌ 90% target missed (likely finish at 45-50% by year-end)
- ❌ Competitive disadvantage (peer unions catch up)
- ❌ Opportunity cost: $1.08M annual value unrealized

**Long-Term:**

- ❌ Union Eyes loses AI leadership position in labor movement
- ❌ Member expectations unmet (slow grievance resolution continues)
- ❌ Recruitment/retention challenges (outdated tools)
- ❌ Sunk cost: $67K already invested (Q4 2025) with limited ROI

**The ask:** Approve today (January 10) → Start execution January 13 → First committee meeting January 15 → 90% by September 30.

**The alternative:** Pause indefinitely → Stagnate at 35% → Waste prior investment → Miss opportunity window.
