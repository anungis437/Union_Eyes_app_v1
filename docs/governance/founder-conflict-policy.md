# Founder Conflict-of-Interest Policy

## Purpose

To prevent conflicts of interest between Union Eyes founders and the union locals they serve, ensuring the platform remains authentically pro-union and free from management influence.

## Background

Union Eyes founders may have worked in various industries before starting the company. Some may have connections to management, employers, or anti-union organizations. This policy ensures complete transparency and prevents any conflicts that could undermine the platform's union-serving mission.

## Blind Trust Requirement

### When Required

A founder MUST establish a **blind trust** for their Union Eyes shares if they:

1. Currently hold OR previously held **union office** (elected or appointed)
2. Have **employer/management background** in industries where unions operate
3. Have **family members** in management positions at unionized companies
4. Hold **board seats** at companies with union-management conflicts
5. Own **shares** in companies currently facing union organizing

### Blind Trust Structure

**Definition**: A legal arrangement where:
- Founder transfers Union Eyes shares to an independent trustee
- Trustee has **sole discretion** over voting rights
- Founder receives only **financial distributions** (no control)
- Founder **cannot influence** company decisions during trust period

**Requirements**:
- **Independent trustee**: No family, business, or union ties to founder
- **Licensed professional**: Lawyer, accountant, or registered trust company
- **Bonded and insured**: $5M minimum professional liability coverage
- **Arms-length**: Cannot have worked with founder in past 5 years
- **Annual reporting**: Reports to Union Eyes Board and Union Member Representative Council

**Trust Duration**:
- **Minimum**: 5 years from union office resignation OR from start of Union Eyes role
- **Extension**: Automatically renews if founder re-enters union office
- **Termination**: Only after 5 consecutive years with zero conflicts
