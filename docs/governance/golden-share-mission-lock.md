# Golden Share Mission-Lock Clause

## Purpose

Protect Union Eyes' union-serving mission from investor interference while allowing normal corporate governance and eventual investor exit.

**Problem Solved**: Prevents mission drift where profit-seeking investors pressure the company to:
- Serve employers instead of unions
- Sell member data
- Deprioritize union needs
- Pursue acquisition by anti-union companies

**Solution**: Special voting share with veto power on mission-critical decisions, but automatic sunset after 5 years of proven mission compliance.

## Golden Share Structure

### Class B Special Voting Share

**Holder**: Elected Union Member Representative Council (5 members)

**Economic Rights**:
- $1.00 redemption value (nominal)
- No dividend rights
- No profit participation
- No liquidation preference

**Voting Rights**:
- **Reserved Matters**: 51% voting power (veto)
- **All Other Matters**: 1% voting power (ordinary)

**Transfer Restrictions**:
- Non-transferable
- Cannot be sold or pledged
- Can only pass to successor Council (elected by union members)

### Election of Union Member Representative Council

**Eligibility**: Active union members in good standing

**Term**: 2 years

**Election Process**:
1. Nomination period (60 days before election)
2. Candidate statements published
3. Online voting (all union members vote)
4. Top 5 vote-getters elected

**Geographic Diversity**: No more than 2 from same province

**Union Local Diversity**: No more than 1 from same union local

**Staggered Terms**: 3 elected in even years, 2 in odd years (continuity)

## Reserved Matters (Veto Rights)

The Golden Share holder (Union Council) has veto power over:

### 1. Mission Changes

**Cannot do without Union Council approval**:
- Change company charter/purpose from union service
- Serve non-union clients as primary business
- Partner with employers in ways that compromise union neutrality
- Rebrand away from union focus

**Examples**:
- ✅ **Allowed without veto**: Add new union-serving features
- ❌ **Requires veto**: Pivot to serve employers exclusively

### 2. Sale/Control Changes

**Cannot do without Union Council approval**:
- Sale of company (>50% ownership transfer)
- Merger or acquisition (Union Eyes acquired)
- Initial Public Offering (IPO)
- Change of control (new majority shareholder)

**Rationale**: Prevents acquisition by anti-union companies or private equity

**Examples**:
- ❌ **Blocked**: Walmart acquires Union Eyes
- ✅ **Allowed**: Union Eyes acquires smaller union tech company

### 3. Data Governance

**Cannot do without Union Council approval**:
- Share member data with employers
- Sell member data to third parties
- Move data outside Canada permanently
- Grant employer access to union-only data

**Rationale**: Protects member privacy and union confidentiality

**Examples**:
- ❌ **Blocked**: Sell anonymized member data to data brokers
- ✅ **Allowed**: Export data for member's own use

### 4. Major Contracts

**Cannot do without Union Council approval**:
- Contracts >$1M annually with employers
- Exclusive partnerships that limit union choice
- Technology licensing to anti-union entities
- White-labeling for employer-focused products

**Rationale**: Prevents financial dependence on employers

**Examples**:
- ❌ **Blocked**: $2M/year exclusive contract with Amazon to monitor warehouse workers
- ✅ **Allowed**: $500k contract with union to customize platform

## Non-Reserved Matters (Normal Voting)

Golden Share holder votes as ordinary shareholder (1% power) on:

### Day-to-Day Operations
- Hiring/firing executives (except CEO)
- Annual operating budgets
- Office leases
- Equipment purchases

### Product Development
- Feature prioritization
- Technology stack choices
- Product roadmap
- Release schedules

### Ordinary Contracts
- Contracts <$1M annually
- Vendor agreements (hosting, SaaS)
- Professional services (legal, accounting)

### Corporate Governance
- Board meeting frequency
- Committee assignments
- Compensation policies (within budget)

**Rationale**: Investors retain control over normal business operations. Union Council only intervenes on mission-critical decisions.

## Sunset Clause (Auto-Expiry)

### Trigger Event 1: 5-Year Mission Compliance ✅

**Condition**: Union Eyes maintains union-serving mission for 5 consecutive years

**Verification**:
1. **Annual Independent Audit**
   - Third-party auditor reviews operations
   - Confirms mission compliance
   - Member satisfaction survey (target: >80%)
   - No mission violations

2. **Metrics Tracked**:
   - % revenue from union clients (target: >90%)
   - Member satisfaction score (target: >80%)
   - Employer interference incidents (target: 0)
   - Data governance violations (target: 0)

3. **Consecutive Years Required**: 5 years
   - Reset if mission violation occurs
   - Example: Violation in Year 3 → restart at Year 0

**Outcome**: After 5 years of compliance, Golden Share automatically converts to ordinary Class A share. Union Council retains economic ownership but loses veto power.

**Rationale**: Demonstrates mission is sustainable without perpetual lock. Investors gain certainty of exit path.

### Trigger Event 2: Supermajority Consent

**Condition**: 75% of Class A (ordinary) shareholders vote to sunset

**Process**:
1. Shareholder proposal filed
2. Union Council notified (60 days notice)
3. Special meeting called
4. Vote held (75% threshold required)
5. If passed, Golden Share converts within 30 days

**Rationale**: Allows early exit if overwhelming shareholder consensus and Union Council comfortable

### Trigger Event 3: Bankruptcy/Dissolution

**Condition**: Company enters bankruptcy or liquidation

**Outcome**: Golden Share automatically converts to $1 redemption claim (no priority)

**Rationale**: Removes complexity in insolvency proceedings

## Cap Table Example

| Shareholder | Class A (Common) | Class B (Golden) | Voting % (Reserved) | Voting % (Normal) |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Founder A | 35% | - | 17.15% | 35% |
| Founder B | 25% | - | 12.25% | 25% |
| Union Council | 15% | 1 share | **58.35%** | 16% |
| Seed Investors | 15% | - | 7.35% | 15% |
| Series A Investors | 10% | - | 4.90% | 10% |
| **Total** | **100%** | **1 share** | **100%** | **100%** |

### Voting Power Calculation

**Reserved Matters** (sale, mission change, data sharing):
- Union Council: 51% (Golden Share) + 7.35% (Class A) = **58.35%**
- Founders: 35% + 25% = 29.4%
- Investors: 15% + 10% = 12.25%

**All Other Matters** (normal operations):
- Founders: 35% + 25% = **60%** (control)
- Union Council: 15% + 1% (Golden) = 16%
- Investors: 15% + 10% = 25%

**Result**: Founders control day-to-day. Union Council blocks mission drift.

## Legal Opinion

### Canadian Corporate Law Compliance

**Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA) Analysis**:

✅ **Section 24 - Share Classes**: Multiple share classes permitted with different voting rights

✅ **Section 140 - Shareholder Agreements**: Sunset provisions and transfer restrictions enforceable

✅ **Section 173 - Fundamental Changes**: Reserved Matters align with statutory voting requirements

✅ **Section 180 - Amendments**: Veto rights on charter amendments permitted

**Provincial Equivalents**: Similar provisions in OBCA (Ontario), BCBCA (British Columbia), QBCA (Quebec)

### Investor Considerations

#### Advantages for Investors
✅ **Clear Exit Path**: 5-year sunset provides certainty
✅ **Limited Scope**: Veto only applies to 4 Reserved Matter categories
✅ **Day-to-Day Control**: Founders/investors control operations
✅ **Aligned Incentives**: Mission compliance = long-term value
✅ **Proven Model**: Similar to B-Corps, dual-class structures

#### Disadvantages for Investors
❌ **Valuation Discount**: Typically 20-30% vs. unrestricted shares
❌ **Exit Complexity**: Sale requires Union Council approval
❌ **Longer Timeline**: 5-year wait for full liquidity
❌ **Mission Risk**: Violation resets 5-year clock

#### Comparable Structures
- **Kickstarter**: Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) with mission lock
- **Patagonia**: Perpetual trust owns voting shares
- **Atlassian**: Dual-class voting structure (founders retain control)

### Tax Implications

**CRA Treatment**:
- Golden Share is voting equity (not debt)
- $1 redemption value = nominal fair market value
- No taxable benefit to Union Council
- Capital gains on conversion (negligible due to $1 value)

## Governance Process

## Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: Investor Exit (Year 3)

**Situation**: Series A investor wants to sell 10% stake to new investor

**Analysis**:
- Not a change of control (<50%)
- Not a Reserved Matter
- Ordinary shareholder transfer

**Voting**:
- Class A shareholders vote (if pre-emption rights invoked)
- Golden Share does NOT have veto power

**Outcome**: Transaction proceeds with normal approval

### Scenario 2: Acquisition Offer (Year 4)

**Situation**: Large HR tech company offers to acquire Union Eyes for $50M

**Analysis**:
- Change of control (>50% ownership transfer)
- Reserved Matter: Sale of Company
- Golden Share veto applies

**Voting**:
1. Class A shareholders vote: 80% approve
2. Union Council votes: **VETO** (4 out of 5 vote no)

**Rationale**: Acquirer has anti-union track record, member data at risk

**Outcome**: Transaction **blocked** despite Class A approval

---

### Scenario 3: Employer Partnership (Year 2)

**Situation**: Amazon offers $2M/year exclusive contract to provide Union Eyes to warehouse managers for "employee engagement"

**Analysis**:

- Golden Share veto applies

**Voting**:
1. Board proposes (attractive revenue)
2. Class A shareholders: 65% approve
3. Union Council: **VETO** (unanimous)

**Rationale**: Conflict of interest, surveillance risk, mission drift

**Outcome**: Contract **rejected**

---

### Scenario 4: Union Client Contract (Year 3)

**Situation**: Major Canadian union signs $800k annual contract

**Analysis**:
- Contract <$1M
- Union client (not employer)

**Voting**: Board approval only (normal business)

**Outcome**: Contract signed immediately

- 2029: ✅ Compliant (93% union revenue, 84% satisfaction)
- 2030: ✅ Compliant (95% union revenue, 86% satisfaction)

**Sunset Trigger**: January 1, 2031

- Union Council retains 15% + 0.01% = 15.01% voting (no veto)
- Founders/investors gain full control on all matters
- Normal governance resumes

**Rationale**: Mission proven sustainable without perpetual lock

---

### Scenario 6: Mission Violation (Year 3)

**Situation**: Union Eyes signs $1.5M contract with employer client without Union Council approval

**Analysis**:

- Material breach of Golden Share agreement
- Auditor flags violation

**Consequences**:
1. Contract voided or requires retroactive Union Council approval
