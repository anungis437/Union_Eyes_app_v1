As we're having more discussion with my VP, collective bargaining, if we're transforming the way unions operate, collective bargaining is also a big part of that. And maybe we've talked about that before, but the challenge with collective bargaining and the maintenance extraction of corporate knowledge is also a challenge. If Mike worked at Union X for 10 years and saw two rounds and know why versions 22 and 23 were drafted the way they were, Mike leaves and then all of a sudden we can't find the emails that were going back and forth or there's something that just disappears. 

Mike's departure cannot mean that the union loses the corporate knowledge it had or that to unearth it or extract it becomes excruciating. And so unionize comes in a way where we take your collective bargaining notes and transform them into hyperlinks and footnotes in your current collective agreement. That way, think about Bible Gateway on the internet when you see a footnote, and then if we can propose to them that there's a way for corporate knowledge to become hyperlinked on a platform where a collective agreement and bargaining issue is, we have revolutionized how corporate knowledge is maintained in unions currently.
