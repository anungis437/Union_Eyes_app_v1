Unions need to be mindful of the incoming crop of new labor relations officers that are tech savvy, that manipulate phones, computers, that are Gen Z and beyond. Because right now what's going on, there's a shift. There's an old guard that is being replaced by people that manipulate like you and I technology.

And unions have to be equipped for these people to be able to do, to continue the work, not to change. And then it's the stand on the shoulder of giants with the help of technology. Right. 

And because we want to make it user friendly for the truck driver, who is also a president of his local section that has like a grade 10 degree. Fine. That person does not like to work with the Microsoft suite, wants to just taps with one finger when he sends a text message. 

Fine. But even if that person will take time to onboard the new platform, we need to be mindful of the 30 year old who was born in technology that is looking for a tool to help them do their job. Like it's 2025 and not like we're doing Canada post strike of 1970.

There's a change in how unions need to do the work. And that's where we come in.
