Okay, just having thoughts conversation with you about unionize as we're preparing to present the the product beyond operationally Providing something that is sound that brings about standardization to the way a union works The why the mission I think is transformation of And unionize we have we have to maybe position ourselves as Transformation of how The fundamentals of a union right because if we if unions were born out of conflict there was an employer and many employees that couldn't speak for themselves conflict and Then to manage that employees get together to come as one voice To Talk to the employer that one voice grew so that What stand started as one voice became multiple voices were there to bring back? like peace within how a union works So that it reduces conflict internally difference in how Say a claim is treated between Regional offices makes it that Ultimately, maybe members are losing on how the union is representation. So if you fix the conflict internally aka unions working in archaic modes and not capitalizing on how to streamline and implement strategies nationally You know to normalize how claims are handled, etc Situ if you fix the fundamental purpose and how it works Then the operational sort of follows So I think that's big picture something to to chew on and to say this is what we're we're here to do to be global like leaders on how unions found global leaders on how unions Find back a way to resolve Internal conflict They're supposed to bring about solutions to conflict externally. We're providing a solution. 

So you fix conflict internally thoughts
